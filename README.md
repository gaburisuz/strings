PlayingWithStrings lets users input a string of 100 characters or less, and then it shows the original string, forwards, and backwards versions, a vertical arrangement, and a triangular pattern. It keeps asking if users want to input another string('Y' or 'N').
This is one of the programs I coded for the C Programming course I took during the Fall semester of 2022. I've taken Introduction to Programming, C++ Programming, Java Programming, and Advanced Java Programming. The first 3 programming courses I mentioned required students to use Cengage, so I don't have any projects to share from those. I wanted to upload a project that I worked on in the Advanced Java Programming course I took last semester, but I have them saved on another laptop. Anyway, it's great to meet you Professor Walauskis and I'm super excited for this course!
